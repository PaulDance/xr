Usage: xr [<command>] [<uuid>]
    h, help   Display a more complete help message.
    c, clean  Remove all the downloaded student submissions.
    n, notes  Print the mentoring notes for the current or given exercise.
    e, edit   Open the mentoring notes in an editor.
    t, test   Run the tests.
    b, bench  Copy the custom benchmarks into 'benches' and run them.

read -r -d '' _long_doc << EOF
Usage: xr [<command>] [<uuid>]

Arguments:
    command   Optional subcommand, see below; when ommitted, defaults to 'test'.
    uuid      Unique identifier for a submission: a 32-digit hex value. If a
              UUID is given, whatever the command used except for 'help', first
              the corresponding exercise is downloaded using \`exercism\` and
              the shell's current directory is changed to the returned value,
              then the command's actual operation is executed.

Commands:
    h, help   Display this message.
    c, clean  Confirm and remove all the downloaded student submissions from
              the filesystem using \`exercism\` in order to determine their
              location.
    n, notes  Dump the contents of the mentoring notes for the current exercise
              to the standard output, as deduced by reading the exercise config,
              or from an exercise or topic of your choice through a second
              argument, but in this case it must be explicitly prefixed with the
              track name like so for example: \`xr notes rust/anagram\`.
    e, edit   Open the mentoring notes for the current exercise in the editor
              specified by the EDITOR environment variable, as deduced by
              reading the exercise's configuration, or from an exercise or topic
              of your choice through a second argument with the same rules as
              'notes'.
    t, test   Source the current track's script functions and run the unit tests
              of the local exercise according to the dedicated function. This is
              the default command when not specifying one but still giving a UUID.
    b, bench  Source the current track's script functions and run the benchmarks
              of the local exercise according to the dedicated function. It is
              usually copying a file to its correct place and call the bencher.
              The path of the file to copy is deduced from the exercise's local
              \`$_exo_config\` configuration file.
